# Suburban Retail Disctricts
Web mapping app for Suburban Retail Districts (D3 version)

Through the Strategies for Older Suburbs work program, staff compiled information about 71 suburban downtown retail districts in an effort to learn what elements were common among successful older suburban retail districts. The information provided through this web application is the culmination of field work and research done by DVRPC staff. The information about each downtown's retail mix was collected between January and April 2013. Retail elements included in this analysis include: management structure, sidewalk width, walkscore, vacancy rate, parking options, anchor institutions, AADTs, Streetscape, national tenancy, lease rents, historic districts, household income, transit accessibility, residential population, events, open space, retail mix, and blocks included for analysis.
